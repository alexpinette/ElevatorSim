A brief description of your project:
- My project was to create an Elevator simulator in C. I used techniques learned in class to accomplish this task. 
I used multiple data structures to hold the information needed to calculate 
when and where passengers were supposed to be. I successfully managed this, and my project 
prints out timed information to the output (log) file, as well as more information is printed in the executable itself.

How to compile & run your code:
- The way to compile and run my code is by making sure you have a GCC compiler or a compiler that handles C code. 
- EX: gcc main.c -lpthread then, execute the C code with these specific parameters: 
		./executable [num_floors] [time_interval] [total_time] 
Given the correct parameters, you will be presented with information based off of the file you told the program to run. You will also see that an output (log) file is generated.

Any known issues with your simulation:
- No known issues are known with my simulation.

Honor Pledge: 
I have abided by the Wheaton College Honor Code and all work below was performed by Alex Pinette.

Notes:
Like you said in the email exchange we had, I asked about the output counters, and I presented a few options so that the user has the most information from the simulation.
